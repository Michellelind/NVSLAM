## How to enhance low light images
In order to enhance low light images changes may need to be made in ***test.py***.<br>
The following steps need to be taken to ensure images are enhanced.

1. Run the following command line: `python test.py -i <INPUT_FOLDER> -r <RESULTS_FOLDER> -m <MODEL_FILE>` <br>
    - <INPUT_FOLDER> needs to be an already existing folder containing your dataset.
    - <RESULTS_FOLDER> does not need to be an existing folder because the code will create if for you. An existing folder can still be used.
    - <MODEL_FILE>  must be a .h5 file.
